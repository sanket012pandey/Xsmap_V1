Xsmap_v1 is an advanced stock market prediction model designed to forecast high-risk volatility regimes in the Indian stock market (NSE). The model combines historical market data, cross-market features, macroeconomic indicators, momentum and trend analysis, and spectral/cyclical features to generate robust predictions using a hybrid ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM, stacked into a meta-model.

This project is ideal for quantitative finance enthusiasts, algorithmic traders, and data scientists interested in predictive analytics for financial markets.
